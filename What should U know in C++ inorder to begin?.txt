Cin / Cout (for input/output)

Pair
    swap
    first
    second
    make_pair
    example : pair<int, int>, pair<char, int>, pair<string, vector<int>>

Vector
    push_back           (fuction)
    size                (fuction)
    empty               (fuction)
    begin               (fuction)
    end                 (fuction)
    rbegin              (fuction)
    rend                (fuction)
    clear               (fuction)
    erase               (fuction)
    ** things to try by yourself **
        for (auto i : vector) tp iterate on vector elements by reference
        for (int i = 0 ; i < vector.size() ; i++) to iterate on vector elements by index
        sort(vector.begin(), vector.end())
        reverse(vector.begin(), vector.end())

Map
    note: elements in map are stored as pairs < key, value >
    example: map["Omar"] = 1; here key is (string) , and value is (int)
    ** map is always sorted depending on the key and you never need to sort it **
    
    clear               (fuction)
    
    ** things to try by yourself **
    for (auto p : map) here p is a pair of key and value pair<key, value>
        the key is p.first, value is p.second

Set
    emplace             (fuction)
    erase               (fuction)
    clear               (fuction)
    size                (fuction)
    begin               (fuction)
    end                 (fuction)
    ** set is always sorted, no need to sort it **
    ** you can never use index to iterate on set, insted you need iteration 
            by reference ** example: for (auto i : set)

Array
    ** The difference between array and vector is that vector has no constant size, 
           while array has limited constant size and must be deleared with the array **
    example : 
        int arr[100]; 
        char arr[10]
        
        const int N = 1e5 (it means 1 * 10^5)
        double array[N]
